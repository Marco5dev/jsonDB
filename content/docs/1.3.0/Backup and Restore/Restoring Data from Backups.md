Restoring data from backups is a crucial process when you need to recover previous versions of your data. jsonverse provides a straightforward way to restore data from your backups.

## Restoring Data

To restore data from a backup, you can use the following code:

```js
const jsonverse = require("jsonverse");

// Replace "yourDataName" with the name of your data
const dataName = "yourDataName";

// Replace "backupFileName" with the name of the backup file you want to restore
const backupFileName = "yourBackupFileName"; 

jsonverse.backupRestore(dataName, backupFileName)
  .then(() => {
    console.log(`Data restored from ${backupFileName} to ${dataName}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error restoring data:", error);
  });
```

This code will restore your data from the specified backup file. Ensure that you replace "yourDataName" with the actual name of your data and provide the correct "backupFileName."

Make sure you have created backups regularly using the "backupCreate" function to have restore points available.

Remember that backups are stored in the "Backup" folder within your data directory and are named with a timestamp indicating when the backup was created.

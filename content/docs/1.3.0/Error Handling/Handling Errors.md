Error handling is an essential part of developing applications with Jsonverse. Jsonverse provides error-handling mechanisms to help you identify and handle various types of errors that may occur during database operations and other tasks.

## Error Handling in Jsonverse

Jsonverse uses both synchronous and asynchronous error handling to ensure that errors are properly managed. You can use try-catch blocks for synchronous error handling and handle asynchronous errors using promises.

Here's an example of how to handle errors when using Jsonverse's methods:

### Synchronous Error Handling

```js
const jsonverse = require("jsonverse");

try {
  // Attempt a database operation
  const result = jsonverse.someDatabaseOperation();

  // Handle the result
  console.log("Operation successful:", result);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error("Error:", error.message);
}
```

In the code above, we wrap the database operation in a try-catch block. If an error occurs during the operation, it will be caught and can be handled in the catch block.

### Asynchronous Error Handling

```js
const jsonverse = require("jsonverse");

// Perform an asynchronous database operation
jsonverse
  .someAsyncDatabaseOperation()
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the result
    console.log("Operation successful:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  });
```

When working with asynchronous operations, we use promises to handle the result or catch any errors that may occur.

## Common Error Types

Jsonverse may throw various types of errors, including validation errors, file system errors, and data-related errors. It's important to familiarize yourself with these error types to effectively handle them in your applications.

Some common error types in Jsonverse include:

- **Validation Error**: Occurs when data doesn't match the schema.
- **File System Error**: Related to file or directory operations.
- **Data Error**: Occurs during data manipulation or database operations.

Jsonverse provides informative error messages to help you identify and troubleshoot issues in your application.

By implementing proper error handling in your Jsonverse-based applications, you can ensure that errors are gracefully managed, and your application remains robust and reliable.

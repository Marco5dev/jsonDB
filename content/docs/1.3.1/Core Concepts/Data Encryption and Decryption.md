Data security is a top priority in jsonverse, and it offers built-in data encryption and decryption features to protect sensitive information. This section explains how to encrypt and decrypt data using jsonverse.

1. **Encrypt Data**:

   To encrypt sensitive data, you can use the `encrypt` method of the jsonverse instance. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   const jsonverse = new jsonverse();
   const dataToEncrypt = { password: 'mySecretPassword' };
   const secretKey = 'mySecretKey';

   const encryptedData = jsonverse.encrypt(dataToEncrypt, secretKey);
   console.log('Encrypted Data:', encryptedData);
   ```

   In this code, we encrypt the `dataToEncrypt` object using a secret key. The result, `encryptedData`, contains the encrypted data.

2. **Decrypt Data**:

   To decrypt encrypted data, you can use the `decrypt` method of the jsonverse instance. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   const jsonverse = new jsonverse();
   const encryptedData = '...'; // Replace with the actual encrypted data
   const secretKey = 'mySecretKey';

   const decryptedData = jsonverse.decrypt(encryptedData, secretKey);
   console.log('Decrypted Data:', decryptedData);
   ```

   This code decrypts the `encryptedData` using the same secret key, resulting in the original data.

3. **Secret Key Management**:

   The secret key used for encryption and decryption should be kept secure. It's essential to implement strong key management practices, such as using key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs), to protect your keys.

4. **Data Sensitivity**:

   Identify the data that requires encryption based on its sensitivity. Sensitive data may include passwords, personal information, or confidential documents.

5. **Encryption Algorithms**:

   jsonverse uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm for data encryption, a widely accepted and secure encryption standard.

6. **Data Security Best Practices**:

   Follow best practices for data security, including access control, encryption at rest, and data masking, to protect sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

7. **Compliance and Regulations**:

   Consider compliance requirements and industry regulations that may dictate data encryption practices, especially when handling sensitive data like healthcare or financial information.

Data encryption and decryption are essential tools to protect your data's confidentiality and integrity in jsonverse. Implement these features to ensure the security of your application's data.

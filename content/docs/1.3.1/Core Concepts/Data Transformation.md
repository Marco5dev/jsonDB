Data transformation is a fundamental concept in jsonverse, allowing you to modify data as needed. This section explains how to perform data transformation using jsonverse.

1. **Transform Data**:

   To transform data, you can use the `transformData` method of the jsonverse instance. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   const jsonverse = new jsonverse();
   const dataName = 'myData';

   // Define a transformation function
   function transformFunction(item) {
     // Modify the item as needed
     item.modifiedField = 'modifiedValue';
     return item;
   }

   jsonverse.transformData(dataName, transformFunction)
     .then(() => {
       console.log('Data transformed and saved successfully.');
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error('Error transforming data:', error);
     });
   ```

   In this code, we define a transformation function that modifies each data item as needed. The `transformData` method applies this function to the data associated with the specified `dataName`.

2. **Transformation Logic**:

   Define your transformation logic based on your specific requirements. You can add, remove, or modify fields within each data item.

3. **Use Cases**:

   Data transformation is useful for various scenarios, including data cleaning, normalization, or preparing data for specific operations.

4. **Data Integrity**:

   Ensure that your transformation logic maintains data integrity and consistency. Validate and test the transformed data to avoid unintended issues.

5. **Transformation Frequency**:

   Determine how often you need to apply data transformations based on your data update frequency and business needs.

6. **Data Transformation as a Middleware**:

   Consider using data transformation as a middleware step between data retrieval and data processing to adapt data to your application's requirements.

7. **Backup Before Transformation**:

   Before performing significant data transformations, create a backup to ensure you can revert to the original data if needed.

Data transformation in jsonverse allows you to shape your data to suit your application's needs. Use it to preprocess, clean, or adapt data for various purposes.

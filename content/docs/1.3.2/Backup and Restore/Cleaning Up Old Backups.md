Regularly cleaning up old backups is essential to manage storage space effectively. jsonverse provides a way to automate the process of removing outdated backup files.

## Deleting Old Backups

To delete old backups that exceed a certain retention period, you can use the following code:

```js
const jsonverse = require("jsonverse");

// Replace "yourDataName" with the name of your data
const dataName = "yourDataName";

// Replace "retentionDays" with the number of days to retain backups
const retentionDays = 30; // Adjust as needed

jsonverse.backupDelete(dataName, retentionDays)
  .then(() => {
    console.log(`Old backups deleted for ${dataName}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error deleting old backups:", error);
  });
```

In this code, replace "yourDataName" with the actual name of your data, and set the "retentionDays" variable to the number of days you want to retain backups. Backups older than this retention period will be deleted automatically.

It's essential to strike a balance between retaining enough backups for data recovery and not consuming excessive storage space. Adjust the "retentionDays" value according to your storage requirements and data backup strategy.

## Backup Cleanup Schedule

You can schedule the backup cleanup process to run at specific intervals, such as daily or weekly, to ensure that old backups are regularly removed and storage space is efficiently managed. Consider using a cron job or a scheduled task, depending on your operating system, to automate this cleanup process.

Remember that cleaning up old backups helps keep your storage organized and avoids unnecessary data clutter.

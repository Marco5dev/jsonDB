Generating unique IDs is a common requirement when working with data. Jsonverse provides a utility method to generate random IDs that you can use for various purposes, such as identifying records or ensuring data uniqueness.

## Generating Random IDs

You can generate a random ID using the following code:

```js
const jsonverse = require("jsonverse");

// Generate a random ID
const randomId = jsonverse.randomID();

console.log("Random ID:", randomId);
```

In the code above, the `jsonverse.randomID` method generates a unique random ID, which you can use in your application to ensure data integrity and uniqueness. This can be particularly useful when creating new records or identifying existing ones.

The generated random ID is a universally unique identifier (UUID) without hyphens, making it suitable for various data management tasks. You can incorporate this functionality into your Jsonverse-powered application to simplify data handling and maintain data consistency.
